This project demonstrates my ability to prepare, analyze, and visualize large datasets. I initialized and cleaned 50GB of data, performed data profiling, loaded data from Excel sheets and TXT/CSV files into staging tables using Talend, consolidated all the staged data using Alteryx into a single unit, maintained a single System Of Record table for authorizing 4 sources for a particular data subject, and implemented graphical dashboards and visualized data on Tableau and Power BI to infer business insights.

This project is a valuable addition to my portfolio and demonstrates my skills in data management, data analysis, and data visualization. I am confident that my skills and experience would be a valuable asset to any team.
